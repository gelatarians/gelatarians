          <li>Gelatarians and all of their subspecies are closed species, meaning you may not create one without a MYO slot.</li>
          <li>All designs are for non-commercial purposes only.</li>
          <li>The Gelatarian team is not trying to gatekeep or claim any of our species' traits as our own. You are free to create ocs inspired by our species, but they will NOT be official and may not be used within the species' events/activities until a MYO slot is used.</li>
          <li>The original designer should always be credited for the design.</li>
          <li>If a gelatarian is found to be a stolen/copied design, they will be permanently voided and the theif will be warned/banned. If you obtained a gelatarian from another user and later find out they are a stolen/ripped off design, please open a report and provide our staff team with proof so we can compensate you.</li>

        <h4 class="text-muted mb-3">Ownership Transfers</h4>
        <ol class="mb-0">
          <li>To transfer to a user, you must fill out the transfer form on <a href="https://toyhou.se/~forums/64510.masterlist/703333.myo-submissions">this forum post</a> and submit it in the comments. It will be transferred by an admin asap, please stay patient!</li>
          <li>Upon trading, reselling or gifting the design to another individual, the previous owner agrees to transfer all ownership rights to the recipient.</li> 
          <li>Gelatarians may only be traded between users if they are official (i.e. you may not advertize a character as a gelatarian if they do not have a masterlist entry). While you are allowed to gift/raffle away unofficial designs within our community, you are not allowed to put them for art, character or monetary offers.</li>
          <li>Staff/members may never revoke a gelatarian from a user no matter the reason.</li>

        <ol class="mb-0">
          <li>While co-owning is allowed within this species, we highly discourage creating 2 toyhouse profiles for the same gelatarian. Only 1 profile may be linked to the masterlist.</li>
          <li>All owners must be listed on the masterlist. There MUST be a main owner; usually the one who holds the toyhouse profile and who will have the gelatarian's masterlist entry visible on their site profile.</li> 
          <li>If a co-owner was added after the oc was submitted to the masterlist, you must send in a report to have the owner list updated.</li>
          <li>To remove a co-owner, you must provide proof that you have permission to remove their co-own status. Exceptions may apply (ex: blacklisted users will have all co-own mentions removed from the masterlist), please contact a staff member if unsure what to do.</li>
          <li>If trading a co-owned gelatarian, you must provide proof that every owner has agreed to put the character up for offer.</li>
          <li>In cases of ownership disputes between co-owners that are brought into our community, staff has the right to void the gelatarian. We are not responsible in any way for ownership disputes, and those must be resolved privately between owners.</li>

          <li>You must ALWAYS disclose when a gelatarian you are submitting is a CBC. Failure to do so will result in a gentle warning, but may turn into a void/ban if you are found to be doing it maliciously.</li>
          <li>If you fail to disclose that your gelatarian is a CBC and it's source material breaks our rules, the character will be voided with no chance to unvoid.</li> 
          <li>CBCs may not be identical copies of their source character/media, and must still clearly be their own character.</li>
          <li>Characters based on songs, albums, game locations, consoles, IP-based species, etc still fall under the CBC umbrella and must be disclosed when submitted.</li>
          <li>We do not allow characters based on real people; this includes celebrities, content creators, singers, historical figures, etc.</li>
          <li>Media of pornographic, criminal or generally problematic/harmful/highly disturbing nature are not allowed within our species. There is not fixed list of medias banned from being turned into CBCs as it is subject to vary from character to character.</li>

          <li>Owners may choose to revert designs to any already approved redesign if desired, even if the old design has traits the the new one doesn't, since it was official at some point you are still able to revert back to it for free if you wish without providing any items.</li>
          <li>If reverting back to an older design, it is your responsibility to provide proof that the design was official at some point in time. Staff will not go searching for it, and we will reject any revert submissions if you fail to provide proof.</li>
          <li>Small design changes such as minor hue/color shifts, outfit/accessory/hairstyle changes, etc do not need any redesign items to be approved.</li>
          <li>Removing a trait from an existing gelatarian is free, but will not refund you any items.</li>

          <li>If redesigning a gelatarian to turn them into a CBC, you must have the designer's permission AND state the CBC clearly in your redesign request.</li>
          <li>If redesigning a CBC gelatarian to become a regular gelatarian (removing all aspects tied to the IP/media they are based on), please state so in your request so the CBC note can be removed.</li>
